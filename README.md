- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ilan Graidy.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a SW Engineer at GSI Technology, working on the simulation and verification of the future company product, called Gemini-2.
- ðŸŒ± My main goal is to share as many code examples as possible, code that will run on Gemini-2.
-    In the future I'm planning on providing an online environment that will allow everyone to run their code there. Until then, a dedicated simulator will be 
-    provided to people who wish to develope on Gemini-2 architecture.
